If you want to run conference calls with your companions or co-workers who are average to below-average in technical prowess, you're going to be providing a LOT of technical support to your group, including being the host, understanding things like \"rendezvous account\", reading abstract blog entries written by developers with little practical guidance, understanding detailed settings, figuring out why everyone's audio is working but video is a black screen (this time, but it worked fine last time), etc. So, if having your calls routed through a company's servers isn't a huge blocker for you, and/or you need reliability, you're, unfortunately, probably better off with Zoom, Slack or Teams. Why am I rating it 4 stars then? Because it does P2P texting and conference calling, and that's really how those things should be done, so if the product isn't as smooth as one by a billion-dollar-a-year company that also probably sells your data and pushes ads and political bias on you constantly, they still deserve at least four stars for it.",
